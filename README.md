K-means clustering from scrach by numpy on a kaggle dataset.
The perpose of writting this file is not accuracy is just the try to write k-means clustering from scrach.
After complete the writting code in numpy ,I try it in scikit-learn to see the difference between my result to scikit-learn.
For simplicity,I only take 3 cluster and two features.
Which features are good and how many cluster is suitable I don't care of it,I only care about my code,which I write from scrach by numpy.
